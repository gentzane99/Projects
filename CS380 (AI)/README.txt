CS380 (Artificial Intelligence for Games):

This course introduces students to a wide range of concepts and practical algorithms that are commonly 
used to solve game AI problems. Case studies from real games are used to illustrate the concepts. Students have a 
chance to work with and implement core game AI algorithms. Topics covered include the game AI programmer mindset, 
AI architecture (state machines, rule-based systems, goal-based systems, trigger systems, smart terrain, scripting, 
message passing, and debugging AI), movement, pathfinding, emergent behavior, agent awareness, agent cooperation, 
terrain analysis, planning, and learning/adaptation.
