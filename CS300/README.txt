CS300 (Advanced Computer Graphics I):

This course introduces students to algorithms that are essential to 
creating photorealistic images in interactive simulations. Topics covered 
include an overview of modern GPU (graphics processor unit) architecture and 
the common graphics APIs used, including OpenGL and DirectX. Rendering techniques 
covered include texturing, illumination models, transparency, shading algorithms, 
mapping techniques (bump mapping, environment/reflection mapping, etc.), and shadows. 
Students learn how to implement all algorithms by using vertex and pixel shaders.
